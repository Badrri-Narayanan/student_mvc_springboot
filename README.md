This is my Spring boot MVC project. It uses Thymeleaf for Front-end and it is secured using Spring Security. This project has 3 type of user roles: Teacher, Principal and Admin. The users of the role Teacher can view and edit the student records, the role Principal has the same permissions except that Principal can also add new students and finally the Admin has all the functionalities of Teacher and Principal in addition to the ability to remove any students. This is a fully functioning Student Management system.
